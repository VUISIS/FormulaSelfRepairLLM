## Self fixing Formula LLM Model

This repo attempts to use langchain and FORMULA such that you can feed into the LLM your broken formula code and then it will fix it for you.

## How to use

1. Install all the dependencies
2. Copy and paste the compiled CommandLine FORMULA program into the CommandLine Folder
	- this folder should contain the following files:
		- Antlr4.Runtime.Standard.dll
		- CommandLine.exe.config
		- Core.dll
		- CommandLine.dll
		- and more
3. Create a new file called config.py (read sample_config.py)
